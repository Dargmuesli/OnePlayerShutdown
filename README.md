# OnePlayerShutdown
Automatically shuts a Minecraft server down when only one player is connected.

## Download
See [Releases](https://github.com/Dargmuesli/one-player-shutdown/releases "Releases").

## Installation
Just put the downloaded .jar into your `plugins` folder and `start` or `reload` your server!

## What this plugin does
Whenever a player is playing alone on a Minecraft Server this plugin enables the server to announce a server shutdown if nobody else joins within two minutes. The time limit can be changed by the user and the plugin can be disabled and enabled again through the `/oneplayershutdown` command.

## Why
For me multiplayer servers are there for people to play with one another. To make sure nobody feels lonely on my Minecraft server I decided to write this plugin to prevent excessive singleplayer gaming on a multiplayer server.
